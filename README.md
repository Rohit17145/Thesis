# Thesis- "Identification of Gastrointestinal-Tract Cancer Signatures and Biomarkers Using Integrative Genomics Approaches" 
Overview

This repository contains the supplementary files and codes used in the thesis titled "IDENTIFICATION OF GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT CANCER SIGNATURES AND BIOMARKERS USING INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES." The work presented in this thesis focuses on utilizing integrative genomics techniques to identify potential cancer signatures and biomarkers associated with gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers, including liver, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers.

The repository includes data preprocessing scripts, statistical and machine learning models, visualization scripts, and supplementary files that support the analysis and findings of the thesis.
